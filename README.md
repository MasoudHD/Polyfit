Calculate the Least Squares Polynomial Fit in C

This library can calculate Polynomial equation coefficients only by having two datasets for x and y values. The usage of this library is very straightforward and has acceptable precision for most applications.

## Notice!!!

This is an open-source library, and I can not guarantee that it is bug-free and operate without any problem, so be careful about using this library in sensitive applications and double-check its performance.
